# Home Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting residential property prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The implementation utilizes a Random Forest Regression model to analyze various housing features and generate accurate price predictions.

## Technical Implementation

The model processes the following key housing features:
- Lot Area
- Year Built
- First Floor Square Footage
- Second Floor Square Footage
- Number of Full Bathrooms
- Number of Bedrooms Above Ground
- Total Rooms Above Ground

The implementation follows a structured machine learning workflow:
1. Data acquisition and preprocessing
2. Feature selection based on domain knowledge
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Performance evaluation using Mean Absolute Error
5. Final model training on the complete dataset
6. Generation of predictions for the test dataset

## Performance

The Random Forest Regressor demonstrates robust predictive capabilities with validation metrics indicating reliable performance for real-world applications in the housing market.
